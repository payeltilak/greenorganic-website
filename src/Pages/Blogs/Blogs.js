    <Accordion.Header>What is the purpose of JWT and how does it work?</Accordion.Header>
    <Accordion.Body>
<h5>
JWT, or JSON Web Token, is an open standard used to share security information between two parties â€” a client and a server.<br/> Each JWT contains encoded JSON objects, including a set of claims.<br/> JWTs are signed using a cryptographic algorithm to ensure that the claims cannot be altered after the token is issued.JSON Web Token is a standard used to create access tokens for an application.<br/>

It works this way the server generates a token that certifies the user identity, and sends it to the client.<br/>

The client will send the token back to the server for every subsequent request so the server knows the request comes from a particular identity.
